    ----------------
    replacement_cost (float): The replacement cost of the battery.
    C_rated (float): The rated capacity of the battery.
    C (float): The actual capacity of the battery.

    L_rated (float): The rated lifetime of the battery.
    v_rated (float): The rated voltage of the battery.
    p (float): The charge/discharged power of the battery.
    r (float): The internal resistance of the battery.
    K_rated (float): The polarization constant of the battery that corresponds to the R1 of the ECM.
